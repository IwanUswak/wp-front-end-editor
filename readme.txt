Front-end Editor is a plugin that lets you make changes to your content *directly* from your site. No need to load the admin backend just to correct a typo.

To edit something, just double-click it.

The main goals are to be *fast* and to be *compatible with any theme*.

**Editable fields:**

* post/page title
* post/page content
* post tags
* text widgets

== Installation ==

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip "Front-end Editor" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.
